libfluff is a general purpose library containing a number of useful modules
for portability and ease of use.

For the most part, the modules in libfluff employ encapsulation.

All defined symbols in the libfluff headers begin with fluff_ or Fluff.

Modules also extensively use the built in memory manager fluff/mm. If memory
usage is a concern, use the function in fluff/mm to disable caching.
